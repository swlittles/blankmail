# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest release | Yes |
| Older releases | No |

We only provide security fixes for the latest release. Please keep BlankMail up to date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by opening a [private security advisory](https://github.com/swlittles/blankmail/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.

Include as much of the following as possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You should receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**. We will work with you to understand the issue and coordinate a fix before any public disclosure.

## Security Model

### Local-First Architecture

BlankMail is a desktop application. Your emails, tokens, and settings are stored locally in a SQLite database on your machine. There are no BlankMail-operated backend servers.

### Authentication & Credentials

- **Gmail**: OAuth 2.0 with PKCE -- no client secret stored. Tokens are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before being saved to the local database.
- **IMAP/SMTP**: Passwords and app passwords are encrypted with AES-256-GCM in the local SQLite database.
- **AI API key**: The OpenRouter API key is encrypted with AES-256-GCM in the local settings table. It is sent only to OpenRouter over HTTPS -- never to any BlankMail server.

### Email Rendering

- HTML emails are sanitized with **DOMPurify** and rendered in a **sandboxed iframe** (`allow-same-origin` only -- no scripts)
- Remote images are **blocked by default** and replaced with placeholders. Users can allowlist specific senders.
- Phishing detection uses 10 heuristic rules to flag suspicious links before you click them

### Network

- All API connections use HTTPS
- Content Security Policy restricts network requests to known domains (googleapis.com, openrouter.ai, Microsoft and Yahoo sign-in, gravatar.com, googleusercontent.com)
- No telemetry, analytics, or tracking

### Dependencies

- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, TipTap, Zustand, DOMPurify, lucide-react
- Backend: Tauri v2 (Rust), async-imap, lettre, mail-parser
- We monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update regularly

## Scope

The following are **in scope** for security reports:

- Authentication bypass or token leakage
- Credential exposure (OAuth tokens, IMAP passwords, API keys)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) via email content escaping the sandbox
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection in the local SQLite database
- Insecure data storage or encryption weaknesses
- Phishing detection bypasses

The following are **out of scope**:

- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to the user's machine (local SQLite is not encrypted at rest by design -- the OS protects user files)
- Denial of service against the local application
- Issues in third-party dependencies with no demonstrated impact on BlankMail
- Social engineering attacks

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure. Please allow us reasonable time (typically 90 days) to address the issue before public disclosure.
- We will credit reporters in release notes unless anonymity is requested.
