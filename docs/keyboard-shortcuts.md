## Multi-select

- **Click** a thread to toggle its selection
- **Shift+click** to select a range
- All keyboard actions (archive, trash, star, etc.) apply to the entire selection

## Two-key sequences

BlankMail supports Vim-style two-key sequences. Press the first key, then the second within 1 second:

- `g` is the only prefix key currently
- If the second key isn't pressed in time, the sequence resets

## Customization

All shortcuts can be rebound in **Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts**. Custom bindings are persisted to the local database and restored on startup. Shortcut definitions live in `src/constants/shortcuts.ts`.
